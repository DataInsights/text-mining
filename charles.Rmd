### Introduction
- Growing evidence suggests that genomic alterations acquired during oncogenesis help tumor cells to escape immune surveillance.[2] In our previous studies, we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) in a larger number of patients with GBC and identified that ErbB signaling is the most extensively mutated pathway that mediates anti-tumor immunity, and elevated ErbB-mutation levels are correlated with a worse outcome in patients with GBC.[2],[16] - However, these studies generally relied on data from bulk tumor profiling, limiting their ability to accurately decipher tumor heterogeneity and genomic variations between individual cells, which are expected to contribute to tumor transformation and poor prognosis.

    
### Strategy 
- Discovery cohort: 13 human GBCs and adjacent normal tissues
  - with or without ErbB pathway mutations
  - fresh biopsy samples from 13 primary GBC tumors and adjacent normal tissues
- Single-cell RNA-sequencing
- Bulk RNA-sequencing
 - immunohistochemical staining
 - immunofluorescence staining 
 - functional experiments
- WES analysis
  - reveal the genomic variations
- Clustering 
  - UMAP plot
- Expression analysis
  - Dot plot
Distribution/Proportion
  - Bar chart 
- Enrichment
  - Heatmap for relative enrichment

### Results
- Tumors with ErbB pathway mutations harbored a larger population of subtype 1 and 2 epithelial cells, Tregs, and M2 macrophages.
- The tumors with ErbB pathway mutations harbored larger populations of epithelial cell subtype 1 and 2, and expressed higher levels of secreted midkine (MDK) than tumors without ErbB pathway mutations.
- We identified 16 cell types from a total of 114,927 cells, in which epithelial cells, M2 macrophages, and regulatory T cells were predominant in tumors with ErbB pathway mutations.
- Moreover, the crosstalk between macrophage-secreted CXCL10 and its receptor CXCR3 on regulatory T cells was induced in GBC with ErbB pathway mutations.
- Crosstalk between macrophage-secreted CXCL10 and its receptor CXCR3 on Tregs was induced in GBC with ErbB pathway mutations.

### Conclusion

- Eleven patients were pathologically diagnosed with gallbladder AC, and 2 were diagnosed with ASC at Xinhua - Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (Fig.
- Introduction\nGallbladder carcinoma (GBC) is the most common cancer of the biliary tract and the sixth most common type of gastrointestinal cancer worldwide.[1],[2] Gallbladder adenocarcinoma (AC) accounts for more than 85% of GBCs, which are characterized by high intra-tumoral heterogeneity and poor prognosis, whereas adenosquamous carcinoma (ASC: <5%) and squamous carcinoma (<2%) constitute a small proportion of GBCs, for which there is insufficient research information available to guide treatment.[3],[4] Even though surgical treatment is commonly used for GBC, the population amenable to surgical treatment is limited, as most patients are diagnosed at advanced stages.
